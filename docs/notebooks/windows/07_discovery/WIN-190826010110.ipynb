    "## Technical Context\n",
    "Often times, when an adversary lands on an endpoint, the current user does not have local administrator privileges over the compromised system.\n",
    "While some adversaries consider this situation a dead end, others find it very interesting to identify which machines on the network the current user has administrative access to.\n",
    "One common way to accomplish this is by attempting to open up a handle to the service control manager (SCM) database on remote endpoints in the network with SC_MANAGER_ALL_ACCESS (0xF003F) access rights.\n",
    "The Service Control Manager (SCM) is a remote procedure call (RPC) server, so that service configuration and service control programs can manipulate services on remote machines.\n",
    "Only processes with Administrator privileges are able to open a handle to the SCM database.\n",
    "This database is also known as the ServicesActive database.\n",
    "Therefore, it is very effective to check if the current user has administrative or local admin access to other endpoints in the network."
