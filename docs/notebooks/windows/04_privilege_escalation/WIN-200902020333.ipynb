    "One of the components of an Event subscription is the event consumer. It is basically the main action that gets executed when a filter triggers (i.e. monitor for authentication events. if one occurs. trigger the consumer).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [MS Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/standard-consumer-classes), there are several WMI consumer classes available\n",
    "\n",
    "* ActiveScriptEventConsumer -> Executes a predefined script in an arbitrary scripting language when an event is delivered to it. Example -> [Running a Script Based on an Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/running-a-script-based-on-an-event)\n",
    "* CommandLineEventConsumer -> Launches an arbitrary process in the local system context when an event is delivered to it. Example -> [Running a Program from the Command Line Based on an Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/running-a-program-from-the-command-line-based-on-an-event)\n",
    "* LogFileEventConsumer -> Writes customized strings to a text log file when events are delivered to it. Example -> [Writing to a Log File Based on an Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/writing-to-a-log-file-based-on-an-event)\n",
    "* NTEventLogEventConsumer -> Logs a specific Message to the Windows event log when an event is delivered to it. Example -> [Logging to NT Event Log Based on an Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/logging-to-nt-event-log-based-on-an-event)\n",
    "* ScriptingStandardConsumerSetting \tProvides registration data common to all instances of the ActiveScriptEventConsumer class.\n",
    "* SMTPEventConsumer \tSends an email Message using SMTP each time an event is delivered to it. Example -> [Sending Email Based on an Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/sending-e-mail-based-on-an-event)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ActiveScriptEventConsumer class allows for the execution of scripting code from either JScript or VBScript engines. Finally, the WMI script host process is `%SystemRoot%\\system32\\wbem\\scrcons.exe`."

    "## Offensive Tradecraft\n",
    "Threat actors can achieve remote code execution by using WMI event subscriptions. Normally, a permanent WMI event subscription is designed to persist and respond to certain events.\n",
    "According to [Matt Graeber](https://twitter.com/mattifestation), if an attacker wanted to execute a single payload however, the respective event consumer would just need to delete its corresponding event filter, consumer, and filter to consumer binding.\n",
    "The advantage of this technique is that the payload runs as SYSTEM, and it avoids having a payload be displayed in plaintext in the presence of command line auditing."
